Here is a API for wedding dresses. It consists of a database (bridal_db) which contains two tables (wedding_dresses,for the dresses and users, for the user register and login) 
Alongside with nodejs,express,cors,dotenv,jwt I have implemented the engin view tool to render the home and the details of the dresses, by filters (of style,fabric,name...) 
With Postman is possible to try the CRUD endpoint which allows to display,add,update and delete items from the DB.
Thanks to JWT the user can register and login, and a token is created.
Unfortunatly due to lack of time i wasnt able to properly render this project with RENDER,as i didnt know i had to create my database in a remote, rather than local.
